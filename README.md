**#7: Does LifeKing come online?**
- Yes of course, 
LifeKing use to come online regularly on Discord. Generally, he comes for editing videos and playing games. He comes to voice chat to talk to his family i.e. his fans.

**#8: How to talk with LifeKing?**
- LifeKing uses to come to text or voice channel on his own whenever he's free for talking with the server members and fans. He created this server for his fans so that he can talk with them and interact with each other. Talkshows are held many times on the server so that everyone can get a chance to talk with LifeKing.
- But there are lots of users and fans on the server and a talkshow with all of them at the same time is impossible and many fans can't get a chance to talk. If does so then the server might face temporary outage issues which will ruin the talkshow. That's why we organize talkshow quite often but with a limited amount of users.
- ***`This is the most asked question on this server. You can't tag him or message him because it would actually disturb him`***.
